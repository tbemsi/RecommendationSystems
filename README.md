# RecommendationSystems

## Project Motivation
In this project I build a recommendation system for articles on the IBM Watson website.
The data was made available by IBM Watson Studio, through Udacity


## Libraries used
* Pandas 0.23.0
* Numpy 1.14.3
* Seaborn 0.8.1
* Matplotlib 2.2.2
* nltk 3.3
* re 2.2.1

## Files in the repository
Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project

## Results of analysis
In the notebook I wrote functions for rank-based and content-based recommendations for the users
in the dataset. Performed an SVD decomposition of the uter-item matrix obtained from the dataset.
